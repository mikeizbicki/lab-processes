# Lab: Working with Processes

This lab will teach you how to run tasks in parallel in the shell.
This is the first steps in completing your twitter analysis homework.

<!--
Portions of this lab require you to work with a partner.
So you should pair up with another student.
Both of you should complete the lab on your own computers,
but you will have to run certain commands for your partner on your own computer at different steps.
-->

## Shell scripting background

### Creating a shell script

Create a file in your home folder called `script.sh` with the following contents
```
#!/bin/sh

while true; do
    date
    sleep 1
done
```
This is a simple shell script that will print the current time in an infinite loop.
Run the command 
```
$ ls -l script.sh
```
to check the permissions of this file.
You should get output that looks similar to
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 52 Jan 22 13:16 script.sh
```
The left-hand sequence of `-rw-r--r--` describes the permissions of the file,
and is particularly important to understand.
In this case, the file has read/write permissions for the user (you), and read permissions for everyone else.

The general semantics of the permission string are summarized in the following picture:

<img src=img/file_permissions.png />

For more details on how to read these permission strings, see [this link](https://mason.gmu.edu/~montecin/UNIXpermiss.htm).

<!--
### Hacking your partner's account (pt 1)

By default, everyone has read access to everyone else's home folder.
Change your current working directory to be your partner's home folder by running the command
```
$ cd /home/username
```
but replace `username` with your partner's username.
Run
```
$ ls
```
to see all the files in their home folder.
One of those files should be the `script.sh` file they created in the previous step.

Run
```
$ vim script.sh
```
and try to edit the file.
You should get an error message saying that you don't have permissions to edit the file.

Now, have your partner run
```
$ chmod a+w /home/username/script.sh
```
again, where `username` is replaced by their real username.
Now you have write permission on the file,
and you can edit it in Vim.

**TASK:**
Change the permissions of your home folder so that other users cannot read the contents of your files.
Note, you should change the permissions of the folder `/home/username` and not the permissions of each individual file.
This will ensure that any new files you create are also hidden.

**NOTE:**
Essentially all hacking boils down to understanding how a computer system is configured differently than the admin of the computer thinks.
Hackers exploit this misconfiguration to their advantage.
-->

### Running the shell file

<!--
Return to your home folder by running
```
$ cd
```
-->
Now, try to execute your script by running the command
```
$ ./script.sh
```
This should fail with the following error message:
```
bash: ./script.sh: Permission denied
```
That's because we haven't given the file execute permissions yet.

Run the following command to give yourself execute permissions
```
$ chmod u+x script.sh
```
Run the `ls -l` command to verify that your permissions have changed,
and then run the file
```
$ ./script.sh
```
This should print the current date/time every second.
You can end the program by pressing `^C`.
(The `^` symbol is the `CTRL` key on your keyboard.
For Mac users, ensure that you are pressing `CTRL` and not `Command`.)

Note that the `./` is required. 
If you ommit it, then you will get the following error:
```
$ script.sh
bash: script.sh: command not found
```

### Background processes

Now restart the program by running 
```
$ ./script.sh
```
again.
This time, however, press `^Z` to end the process.
This will return you to the command prompt,
but unlike `^C` it does not end the program.
`^Z` temporarily pauses the program,
and you can restart it by running
```
$ fg
``` 
(The `fg` stands for foreground.)
You can pause programs and restart them an arbitrary number of times.

Note that when the process has been paused with `^Z`,
it is not running anymore.
To run the program in the background, enter `bg` (stands for background) instead of `fg`.
Notice that you can still type on the command prompt,
but that `script.sh` is continuing to print out messages while you type.

Press `^C`.
Notice that this does not stop the background process.
To end the process,
first bring it back to the foreground with the command
```
$ fg
```
then press `^C` to terminate the process.

List all the processes running in your current shell with the command 
```
$ ps
```
You should get output that looks like
```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
12906 pts/8    00:00:00 ps
31170 pts/8    00:00:00 bash
```
although the `PID` values will be different.
Each line corresponds to a process that has been started from your current session.
`bash` is the command interpreter that you are typing commands into,
and `ps` is the command that you just ran.

Later on we'll need more detailed information about the processes,
and you can get this more detailed output by adding the `-f` flag:
```
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
user     14694 31170  0 13:52 pts/8    00:00:00 ps -f
user     31170 31166  0 10:24 pts/8    00:00:00 bash
```

Now run `./script.sh`, type `^Z` to pause it, then type `ps` again.
You should now see additional lines in your output, something like:
```
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
12900 pts/8    00:00:00 script.sh
12902 pts/8    00:00:00 sleep
12906 pts/8    00:00:00 ps
31170 pts/8    00:00:00 bash
```
The `script.sh` corresponds to the command you directly executed,
and the `sleep` corresponds to the command that is currently being executed by `script.sh`.
It is possible that instead of the `sleep` command, you will see the `date` command,
depending on where the program stopped.

The process id (pid) is how we communicate with processes.
Every time you start a program, a new process is created.
The `PID` column of `ps`'s output will always be unique,
but the other columns may not be.

### Output redirection

Run the following command in your terminal
```
$ ./script.sh > output
```
You should notice that the program is running, 
but no output is being printed to the screen.

> **RECALL:**
> You know the program is running because no prompt (`$`) is printed to the screen,
> and you can't enter commands.
> The `>` symbol is called output redirection,
> and sends all of the output of your program into the `output` file.
> (`output` can be replaced with any filename you'd like, and is just an example filename.)

After waiting a few seconds, press `^C` to end the program.
Now open the `output` file in Vim
```
$ vim output
```
You should see several lines printed out that contain results of running your `./script.sh` file.

You can run this program in the background by running
```
$ ./script.sh > output
```
and then pressing `^Z` to pause the program and then entering
```
$ bg
```
to run it in the background.
Now, the `output` file is being continually written to.
To verify this:
open the file in Vim;
check how many lines have been written;
close the file;
reopen the file in Vim;
now there should be more lines in the file.

Alternatively, the command `wc -l` shows how many lines are in a file.
Run the command
```
$ wc -l output
```
then wait a few seconds and run the command again.
You should get different numbers both times.

### Killing processes

We've already seen that we can stop the `./script.sh` command by running the `fg` command and then typing `^C`.
`^C` sends a special signal to a process called `SIGINT`,
and the default response to this signal is to terminate.
Another way to stop the program is by directly killing it with the `kill` command.
`kill` takes a pid as a command line argument,
and you should run 
```
$ kill <PID>
```
where `<PID>` is the pid displayed by the `ps` command of your `./script.sh` process.
Go ahead and kill the process that you currently have running in the background from the previous section.

The `kill` command has many uses for manipulating process.
The most common other variation that you will need to know is `kill -9 <PID>`.
Without the `-9`, `kill` asks the process to "politely" kill itself,
performing a clean shutdown by (for example) saving any open files.
When a program breaks, however, these polite killings sometimes may not happen or may take too long.
Adding the `-9` flag forces the operating system to kill the process immediately without performing a clean shutdown.
This should be done if a polite kill request didn't work.

> **ASIDE:**
> If you find the term "polite kill request" humorous, you're not alone.
> There's lots of programming jokes about these concepts.
> For example:
> 
> <img src=img/kill.webp width=300px />
> <br>
> <br>
> <img src=img/kill2.webp width=300px />

### Multiple connections

Create a second connection to the lambda-server with a separate terminal window and separate `ssh` session. 
Run the command
```
$ ps
```
in both windows and notice that you get different outputs.
The `ps` command by default outputs only the processes that were created from your current connection.

To list all processes, run the command
```
$ ps -e
```
The `-e` flag causes `ps` to list "every" process on the system.
You should see a very long list that is multiple pages long.

Now run the command
```
$ ps -ef
```
The `-f` flag causes `ps` to print the "full" information about each process.

> **Note:**
> All of the following commands are equivalent: `ps -e -f`, `ps -f -e`, `ps -fe`, and `ps -ef`.
> By convention, parameters that take only a single `-` and a single letter can be combined together into a single command,
> and the order that we apply them doesn't matter.

Importantly, the first column in the output is the username of the user who created the process.
We can therefore combine the `ps -ef` command with the pipe `|` and `grep` to list just the processes for a single user.
Run the command
```
$ ps -ef | grep <username>
```
replacing `<username>` with your actual username on the lambda server.
You should see all the processes created from both of your connected sessions,
and none of the extra processes owned by different users.

> **NOTE:**
> If you have a particularly long username,
> the command above may not work for you as written.
> The output of `ps -ef` will truncate usernames that are too long,
> and so the `grep` command won't be able to find them.
> If you use the first 6 characters of your username in the grep command (instead of your full username),
> then the command should work.

Back to our `script.sh` command.
Go ahead and run it in one terminal session:
```
$ ./script.sh
```
then in the other, run our command for listing all of your processes:
```
$ ps -ef | grep <username>
```
You can see what processes other users are running with the same command.
Just replace `<username>` with their username instead.

### The `HUP` signal

We've seen three ways to kill processes:
pressing `^C`, running the `kill` command, and running the `kill -9` command.
Another way to kill processes is by sending the `HUP` signal.
The `HUP` signal is automatically sent to all "children" processes of your shell when the connection is closed (`HUP` stands for "hang up").
This ensures that you don't accidentally leave processes running on machines that you're not actively using.
If we didn't have the `HUP` signal, then everytime bad wifi disconnected you from the lambda server,
your `vim` and `bash` processes would continue running forever,
and eventually the lambda server would run out of resources.

To see how this works,
run the command
```
$ ./script.sh > output2
```
then type `^Z` and run
```
$ bg
```
to send your shell script to the background.
Verify that this program is running in the background by executing the command
```
$ ps -ef | grep username
```
in the OTHER TERMINAL YOU HAVE OPEN.

Next, close the ssh session that you used to run `script.sh` by running the command
```
$ exit
```
In your second ssh session (that is still connected),
again run the command
```
$ ps -ef | grep username
```
and notice that your `script.sh` process is no longer running.
This is because when you closed your ssh connection,
the `HUP` signal was sent to the `script.sh` process,
ending the process.

> **NOTE:**
> Be default on most Linux machines, the `ssh` program sends the `HUP` signal automatically when it disconnects.
> This is polite to do:
> Since we know we won't be using those processes any more, we should kill them and free their resources.
> But on some machines (especially Macs), the `ssh` program is configured to not send the `HUP` signal automatically.
> Therefore, the programs will not be immediately terminated.
> The lambda server waits about ten minutes before sending the `HUP` signal and terminating the processes itself.
> (This delay is necessary to handle temporary disconnects due to things like bad wifi.)
> If you are using a `ssh` program configured in this way,
> then you won't immediately see your programs be killed by the `HUP` signal when you logout.
> These programs will eventually be killed by the lambda server,
> but you don't need to wait for the server to kill them before progressing with the lab.

### Blocking the `HUP` signal

Sometimes we want to have long running processes that last longer than our current sessions.
To do this, we can use the `nohup` command to block the `HUP` signal.
(UNIX programmers like simple names :)

Reconnect a second terminal to the lambda server,
and in this terminal run the command
```
$ nohup ./script.sh > output2
```
Notice that the only difference between this command and the previous section is the use of the `nohup` command.
Then type `^Z` and run
```
$ bg
```
to send your shell script to the background.
Verify that this program is running in the background by executing the command
```
$ ps -ef | grep username
```
in the OTHER TERMINAL YOU HAVE OPEN.

Next, close the ssh session that you used to run `script.sh` by running the command
```
$ exit
```
In your second ssh session (that is still connected),
again run the command
```
$ ps -ef | grep username
```
and notice that your `script.sh` process is still running.
This command will run forever if it is not manually killed.
Use the `kill` command to end your `script.sh` process.

When you launch long-running processes on the lambda-server,
you will have to use the `nohup` command to ensure that they continue to run after you have disconnected.

### Automatic backgrounding with `&`

In our previous experiments, we have been manually sending programs to the background by pressing `^Z` and typing `bg`.
In our shell scripts, we will want to automate this process.
We can do this by placing an `&` at the end of a command.

Run the command
```
$ nohup ./script.sh > output3 &
```
and notice that the program seems to run and exit immediately.
But it is in fact still running.
You can verify this by running the
```
$ ps
```
command to view the process information,
and you can run
```
$ cat output3
```
to watch the contents of `output3` grow as `script.sh` appends to it.
(Try running the `cat` command multiple times, waiting a few seconds between each run.)

## Twitter Analysis

We now have all the tools we need to write a program to analyze terabytes of tweets massively in parallel.
We'll start by counting how many times the word "coronavirus" was used in each month of the year 2020.

<!--
Recall that in the [pipes lab](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/lab-pipes-twitter), we created commands that counted the number of tweets sent on a particular day:
```
$ unzip -p '/data/Twitter dataset/geoTwitter20-04-01.zip' | grep -i "coronavirus" | wc -l
```
This command first unzips the file, then uses grep to remove tweets that don't contain "coronavirus", and counts the number of tweets that remain.
Our goal is to run a command like this for the first day of each month.
(We'll start by running on just 12 days before jumping up to all 1800 in the dataset.)
-->

Create a file called `lab.sh` with the following code inside of it:
```
#!/bin/sh
for file in '/data/Twitter dataset/'geoTwitter20-*-01.zip; do
    echo "$file" "$(unzip -p "$file" | grep -i coronavirus | wc -l)" &
done
```

> **NOTE:**
> Ensure that you understand what everything in the code block above does.
> For your homework, you will have to write files like this from scratch.

Give yourself execute permissions to the file by running
```
$ chmod u+x lab.sh
```
And then run the file with output redirection
```
$ nohup ./lab.sh > output
```
You'll notice that the program appears to finish immediately,
but if you run
```
$ ps -ef | grep <username>
```
you'll see all of the running processes.
And there's a LOT of processes.
The output is rather complicated because there are many processes being created per file (e.g. `unzip`, `grep`, and `wc`).
We can simplify this output to see exactly one line per file by running another grep command to display only the running `unzip` commands:
```
$ ps -ef | grep <username> | grep unzip
```
Now, you should see one (very long) line per file,
and the line will contain the name of the file that was passed to `unzip`.
The only way for you to know that your data analysis has finally finished is to keep running this `ps` command until you don't get any more output;
at that point, all of the programs have terminated.

> **ASIDE:**
> Actually, you can monitor your progress with more fine-grained control using the `top` and `atop` commands.
> Running
> ```
> $ top -u <username>
> ```
> will show you in real-time which of your processes are running and consuming the most CPU resources.
> Running
> ```
> $ atop
> ```
> will show you what resources are being consumed on the lambda server.
> In this case, our computation is very simple.
> The lambda server has 80 CPUs, but only 16 hard drives (HDDs).
> So the bottle-neck will be hard drive speed.
> The output of `atop` will show that the HDDs are being maxed out with these commands.
> Therefore, you are likely to not have your parallel program run 12x faster than your sequential program.
> My parallel program ran "only" about 8x faster due to this bottleneck.
> More CPU intensive code, however, can get up to an 80x speed up by running in parallel on the lambda server.

Once your analysis is done, you can view the results that you save with output redirection:
```
$ cat output
```
Unfortunately, you'll notice that the results are not in chronological order.
Instead, they are listed in the order that the files finished processing.
Parallel programming is what we call *nondeterministic*,
which means that the order of the results will change everytime you run the program due to factors outside of our control.

Fortunately, we can easily recover a chronological ordering using the `sort` command:
```
$ cat output | sort
```

## Submission

Paste the output of your
```
$ cat output | sort
```
command to sakai.

If you finish early, you should start the typespeed caveat task if you have not already done so.
At this point, you have seen all of the terminal tricks needed to understand both the main task and the extra credit.

<!--
## Optional: Hacking your classmate's github accounts

Recall that *hacking* in the computer world means doing something cool.
What muggles think of as "hacking" is actually what hackers call *cracking*.
In this last section of the lab, you will *crack* into other user's github accounts.

Many of you have sored your personal access token in a file called `pat` in your home folder.
(This is how I recommended you store your pat.)
Unfortunately, the default permissions for files includes read permissions for all users.
This means that everyone has access to your pat and can use it to login to github under your account name.

Let's use our knowledge of UNIX commands to find all of these `pat` files so that we can steal these credentials.
Recall that the `find` command will recursively list all of the files inside of a folder.
We can then pipe the output to grep to search for files named `pat` with a command like
```
$ find /home | grep 'pat'
```
You'll notice that this is listing too many files, and there's 2 reasons fo this:
1. The regex `pat` matches the string `pat` anywhere in the path name,
    and we want to only find files that are named `pat`.
    The regex `/pat$` will match only paths that end in the string `/pat`,
    and so this will guarantee that the corrersponding file is named `pat`.
1. The `find` command prints an error message to *stderr* when it encounters a path it doesn't have read permissions for.
    These error messages are not part of *stdout*,
    and so are not piped to the grep program for filtering;
    they are printed directly to the screen.
    We can disable these error messages by adding redirecting stderr for the find command to `/dev/null` with the incantation `2>/dev/null`.
    (Notice the `2` in front of the `>` indicates we are redirecting stderr instead of stdout.)

If you modify the `find`/`grep` command above to take into account these changes,
then the resulting command will print all of the `pat` files that contain login credentials to github.

**Your task:**
Use the login credentials of someone to login to their github account and make an "innocuous" change to one of their repos.
This will demonstrate that you have "pwned" them,
and you will have earned the right to mock them ruthlessly.

**Your other task:**
If your github credentials are currently vulnerable this way,
you should modify the permissions of your `pat` file with the `chmod` command so that others cannot read the file.
You should also disable this pat and create a new one.
I've already copied all of these credentials,
and I may choose to have "fun" with your account later if you don't disable them.

The vast majority of times when a company is hacked,
it is because sensitive information was not stored correctly with proper access controls.
This allows people from the public who shouldn't have access to the information (whether it be passwords, client information, or other trade secrets) to gain access.
-->

<!--
### Hacking your partner (2)

Run
```
$ finger
```
to list all the ssh sessions currently logged in.
Because there is likely to be a lot of users logged into the lambda server right now,
it may be useful to use piping and grep to display only the lines that contain your partner's information:
```
$ finger | grep username
```
This command lists lots of information about each session,
but the important thing for right now is the `Tty` column.

**Historical Note:** `Tty` stands for "teletypewriter", 
which was the original name for a terminal way back in the day when monitors didn't exist and terminal sessions were input on typewriters and output on a printer.
Today, each terminal session has a unique `tty` file.
These are special files located in the `/dev/pts` folder on Linux machines.
By writing to these files, we can write to the different terminals open on the computer;
and by reading from these files, we can read from the different terminals.

Under the `Tty` column of finger's output is a line that looks something like `pts/23`,
(the number `23` will be different for every terminal session).
There is a file in the `/dev/pts` folder that corresponds to your partner's terminal session;
if the finger command shows that their tty is `pts/23`, for example, then the file is `/dev/pts/23`.
Run the following command to write to their terminal:
```
$ write username pts/23
```
Now, whatever you type as input to the write program will be displayed on their terminal.
You have permission to write to their screen because the `/dev/pts/23` file by default gives write permission to everyone in the same group.

In order to prevent someone from writing to your screen,
you need to change the group permissions so that writing is not allowed.
Do this by running
```
$ chmod g-w /dev/pts/23
```
Now, when other people try to write to your screen,
they will get permission denied errors.
-->
